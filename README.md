# 📘 Third Semester DSA Java Code Practice – Java 💻

Welcome to the Java practice repository for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, created during the third semester. This collection of Java files covers fundamental DSA topics and programming concepts—perfect for learning, revising, or interview prep.

All code is written in **Java** and tested using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run these programs locally, make sure you have the following:

- ✅ Java JDK 8 or higher
- ✅ Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- ✅ Java Extension Pack installed in VS Code
- ✅ Terminal access to `javac` and `java` commands

| `BubbleSort.java`             | Sorts an array using the bubble sort algorithm with step tracking. |
| `Catalog.java`                | Simple catalog system using arrays or object-oriented approach. |
| `ConsoleSortingVisualizer.java` | Visualizes sorting algorithms step-by-step in the console. |
| `DescendingOrder.java`        | Sorts numbers in descending order using sorting logic. |
| `HelloWorld.java`             | Basic “Hello, World!” program – your first Java file! |
| `LowBalanceAccount.java`      | Simulates a banking system that flags low-balance accounts. |
| `MergeSort.java`              | Implements merge sort using recursion and divide-and-conquer. |
| `MusicPlaylistManager.java`   | Manages a music playlist (add, remove, search songs). |
| `ReverseString.java`          | Reverses a string using loops or Java utilities. |
| `ReverseName.java`            | Reverses a user's name input character-by-character. |
| `SelectionSort.java`          | Implements the selection sort algorithm. |
